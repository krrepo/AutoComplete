lists of terms that are available for auto-complete.

#### Client Configuration

command to display your current config settings or alter them.

    $ tasc config
    Configuration:
    +----------------+--------------------+
    | Key | Value |
    +----------------+--------------------+
    | current_server | dev                |
    | default        | localhost:8080     |
    | testsvr        | 127.0.0.1:81       |
    | foo            | bar:80             |
    | dev            | 10.45.205.204:8080 |
    | testingsq      | 1.1.02.10:3333     |
    | bchee          | 10.115.100.77:8080 |
    +----------------+--------------------+

#### List Management

* upload & download a list in a file 
* add, update, remove entries from a list
* create, delete, update, show a list

#### List Configuration
Supports 2 types of lists:
* static - list of pre-determined items, use the _upload_ command
* dynamic - list is generated by usage, use the _create_ command

Dynamic lists are self-maintaining.  The TrieService keeps track of each
entry's usage and age.  You can configure a maximum number of entries
that will be maintained.  When the max size is reached, the usage and age is used to sort
the list and remove the least-frequently used item (LFU).
